# Notes

### Java

<details>
  <summary>OOP</summary>
  
  - Abstraction: develop classes in terms of their own functionality, instead of their implementation details.
  - Encapsulation: objects hide their internal characteristics and behavior.
    - Hide internal state
    - Usability and maintenance of code
    - Modularity
  - Polymorphism
  - Inheritance
  - Predefined & user-defined types as objects 
  - Message-based
  
  Java not 100% OO becquse of primitives types.
