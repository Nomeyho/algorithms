# Notes

### Java

<details>
  <summary>OOP</summary>
  
  - Abstraction: develop classes in terms of their own functionality, instead of their implementation details.
  - Encapsulation: objects hide their internal characteristics and behavior.
  - Polymorphism: present the same interface for differing underlying data types.
    - Compile-time polymorphism (Static binding) – Method overloading
    - Runtime polymorphism (Dynamic binding) – Method overriding
  - Inheritance: acquire fields and methods of the base class.
  - Predefined & user-defined types as objects.
  - Message-based.
  
  Java not 100% OO becquse of primitives types.

<details>
  <summary>Hello World</summary>
  
  ```
  public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]) {  
      System.out.println("Hello World");  
    }
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Primitive Types</summary>
  
  Boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Association vs Aggregation vs Composition</summary>
  
  - Association: link between two classes communicating with each other.
  - Aggregation and Composition are special cases of association.
  - Composition: the child cannot exist independent of the parent.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>JVM</summary>
  
  Process vthat can execute Java bytecode.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>JRE vs. JDK</summary>
  
  - JRE is a JVM implementation
  - JDK includes the JRE and development tools.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Static</summary>
  
  - Static variable/method can be accessed without instantiation.
  - Static class: TODO
  - Static block: code executed when loading the class in memory
</details>
