# Notes

### Java

<details>
  <summary>OOP</summary>
  
  - Abstraction: develop classes in terms of their own functionality, instead of their implementation details.
  - Encapsulation: objects hide their internal characteristics and behavior.
  - Polymorphism: present the same interface for differing underlying data types.
    - Compile-time polymorphism (Static binding) – Method overloading
    - Runtime polymorphism (Dynamic binding) – Method overriding
  - Inheritance
  - Predefined & user-defined types as objects 
  - Message-based
  
  Java not 100% OO becquse of primitives types.
